                    <h3>Vegan burger</h3>
                    <br />
                    <h4>This veggie burger recipe is both vegetarian and vegan but it has bread in the mix so it isn't gluten-free. Combine mashed beans, bread, chopped onions, and seasoning and make patties. Because the patties aren't dense, these are best when pan-fried or baked.In a large bowl, mash the beans until almost smooth with the help of a potato masher or for. Stir well with a wooden spoon once the desired texture is achieved.Add 1/2 tablespoon of oil to grease the bottom of a small frying pan. Add the onions and sauté them until they are soft and translucent, about 3 to 5 minutes.Add the crumbled bread slices, seasoned salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix well with a wooden spoon.Use the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil to pan-fry the burgers over medium-low heat. Allow the patties to slightly firm-up and brown on each side, about 3 minutes. If your pan is too hot, the burgers will brown too quickly and not be heated through and cooked in the middle, so adjust the heat as needed.</h4>

                    <h4> Mash the banana and stir it into the coconut yogurt. Mash the raspberries with jam (if using).In three glasses or jars, layer yogurt mix, fruit, granola and mashed raspberries attractively. Garnish with coconut chips, fresh mint and a drizzle of honey.This muesli is inspired by the flavours of Christmas. It is sweetened naturally with honey, and juicy dried figs and cranberries, and packs a delicious spice punch thanks to the cinnamon and ginger toasted rolled oats. A yummy breakfast to enjoy with fresh seasonal berries and creamy yoghurt in the lead-up to Christmas!
